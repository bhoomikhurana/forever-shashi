It was a particularly useful tool to create robust engagement between the program implementation team and the community members and gain an insight into the village and block dynamics and locating the important institutions and influential people in the area. Behavioural Matrix was applied to capture the various findings related to the community behaviour in terms of adolescent empowerment in a standardized and structured manner. This matrix has served to measure the variance for various behavioural pattern. This approach has proposed strategy to minimize the apparent Gap and thus lead to develop a flexible implementation strategy that would have a wider acceptability at community level. \n\nWe also engaged with the organisation to conduct Early Marriage study in the state of Bihar and were also part of the team to introduce Biometrics as a social innovation tool in government schools for program implementation in the state of Uttar Pradesh.",
