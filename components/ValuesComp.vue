      <h2>Our Values</h2>
    </div>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Experiential and participatory learning</b><br />
        Concepts and learning taught through experiential and participatory
        learning approaches sticks with an individual for a much longer time. We
        believe that simply giving awareness on an issue is not the solution but
        through hands-on experience based, learner-focussed learning
        opportunities for them to relate to the social issues and themes on a
        personal and societal level. This also allows the learners to reflect
        and engage with the concepts more deeply allowing space for more
        creativity and innovative thinking to thrive.
      </li>
      <br />

      <li>
        <b>Strategic collaborations and networking</b><br />
        We believe in the strength of collective access and having a support
        network to depend on for psycho-social support to face challenges and
        implement solutions. This is why we are always looking to find
        collaborators to create better opportunities, build bigger platforms and
        reach more youth to make an impact which lasts.
      </li>
      <br />

      <li>
        <b>Commitment to community and wellbeing</b><br />
        In todayâ€™s day and age wellbeing is an essential component of any entity
        to ensure they are able to live full and productive lives. Our
        commitment will always lie with the individuals and community to ensure
        that our actions help in improving the quality of life and enable them
        to give back to society to continue the cycle of giving and upliftment
        of ourselves, community and society.
      </li>
      <br />

      <li>
        <b>Equity and Ethics based decision making</b><br />
        It is our motto to make equity and ethics a conscious aspect of our
        daily work and life.While working with vulnerable members of society
        such as young children it becomes our duty to ensure that they face no
        harm or become victims or malicious or nefarious intentions and crimes.
        We also apply these principles inwards among our organisation members as
        well. We place great importance on the principles of equity and ethics
        guiding all our decision making processes.
      </li>
      <br />

      <li>
        <b>Incorporating sustainability in all processes</b><br />
        As an organization envisioning a more sustainable world with human
        development co-existing with flourishing natural systems, sustainability
        is a principle and way of life that we strive to incorporate in our
        works and processes.
