          <h3>Experiential and participatory learning</h3>
          <p>
            Concepts and learning taught through experiential and participatory
            learning approaches sticks with an individual for a much longer
            time. We believe that simply giving awareness on an issue is not the
            solution but through hands-on experience based, learner-focussed
            learning opportunities for them to relate to the social issues and
            themes on a personal and societal level. This also allows the
            learners to reflect and engage with the concepts more deeply
            allowing space for more creativity and innovative thinking to
            thrive.

          <h3>Strategic collaborations and networking</h3>
          <p>
            We believe in the strength of collective access and having a support
            network to depend on for psycho-social support to face challenges
            and implement solutions. This is why we are always looking to find
            collaborators to create better opportunities, build bigger platforms
            and reach more youth to make an impact which lasts.

          <h3>Commitment to community and wellbeing</h3>
          <p>
            In todayâ€™s day and age wellbeing is an essential component of any
            entity to ensure they are able to live full and productive lives.
            Our commitment will always lie with the individuals and community to
            ensure that our actions help in improving the quality of life and
            enable them to give back to society to continue the cycle of giving
            and upliftment of ourselves, community and society.

          <h3>Equity and Ethics based decision making</h3>
          <p>
            It is our motto to make equity and ethics a conscious aspect of our
            daily work and life. While working with vulnerable members of
            society such as young children it becomes our duty to ensure that
            they face no harm or become victims or malicious or nefarious
            intentions and crimes. We also apply these principles inwards among
            our organisation members as well. We place great importance on the
            principles of equity and ethics guiding all our decision making
            processes.

          <h3>Incorporating sustainability in all processes</h3>
          <p>
            As an organization envisioning a more sustainable world with human
            development co-existing with flourishing natural systems,
            sustainability is a principle and way of life that we strive to
            incorporate in our works and processes.
