          Forever Shashi Foundation's vision is to nurture modern environmental,
          social empowerment and sustainable development values and practices by
          bridging society, knowledge from our environment. Our focus is to
          build and create a society where the communities are made-up of and
          led by resilient youth with civic responsibilities towards environment
          and society being an intrinsic part of their identity.

          Unfortunately, we are far more comfortable making individual
          environmental choices than we are getting involved in local
          decision-making. This mindset is reflected in most environmental
          outreach. The question is how do we change this dynamic?
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Research tells us that young people develop their sense of civic and
          environmental efficacy and start imbibing social norms between the
          ages of 10 and 14. If, during this time they can, while learning,
          solve problems that plague the environment and hence the society, then
          this action will become their tool of choice. This will also make sure
          that young people who have these experiences will continue to use
          similar means to solve environmental and social problems into
          adulthood. We believe that by engaging children from an early age,
          they can foster a culture of responsibility, empathy and leadership
          among the future generations. By investing in the potential of young
          leaders, it can foster a more inclusive, equitable, sustainable and
          clean world.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          We endeavor to build a strong and responsible civil society, good
          environmental practices via a passionate youth to safeguard our
          environment, foster ethical societal values and improve the
          individual’s and peoples’ lives.

              SDG 11: Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe,
              resilient and sustainable
            </h4>

            <p>
              As the cities are becoming more populous and seeing rapid
              development of infrastructure, the surrounding environment is
              slowly disappearing. More and more people are living in urban
              slums without the basic facilities of clean water, quality food or
              clean air. Often, the people living in such impoverished
              backgrounds are the first victims of development and climate
              change. It is becoming more and more critical day by day to ensure
              that cities are built to be eco-friendly, sustainable and
              resilient in order to continue thriving and surviving.

              SDG 12: Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns
            </h4>

            <p>
              The world is seeing rampant obesity and chronic malnutrition at
              the same time. Not only is there a major divide between access to
              basic food and nutrition, more and more food available in the
              markets are being grown and exposed to pesticides and other
              chemicals while being grown in land which has lost a majority of
              its nutrition causing a shortage of good quality raw food further
              exacerbating the issue of sustainable consumption and production
              patterns leading to a rise in lifestyles health issues and
              diseases.

              SDG 13: Take urgent action to combat climate change and its
              impacts
            </h4>

            <p>
              Climate change disproportionately affects vulnerable communities,
              exacerbating existing inequalities. By prioritizing climate
              action, SDG 13 aims to ensure that climate policies and actions
              consider social equity, human rights, and economic opportunities
              for all, leaving no one behind. The importance of SDG 13 lies in
              its recognition of the urgent need to address climate change
              comprehensively and collaboratively. By inculcating the need and
              relevance for environment conscious behaviour and sustainable
              practices we can create a cadre of youth who can foster a more
              sustainable, resilient, and equitable world for current and future
              generations.

              SDG 16: Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable
              development, provide access to justice for all and build
              effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels
            </h4>
            <p>
              SDG 16 focuses on promoting peaceful, just, and inclusive
              societies and aims to build effective, accountable, and inclusive
              institutions at all levels. It addresses critical issues related
              to governance, rule of law, access to justice, human rights, and
              reduction of violence and conflict. Building strong and
              accountable institutions is crucial for achieving sustainable
              development. This can be done by ensuring that decision-making
              processes are inclusive, responsive, and participatory. Empowering
              marginalized groups and amplifying their voices in policymaking
              helps address inequalities and ensures that no one is left behind
              in the development process. This makes it crucial for values of
              human rights, democratic rights and citizenship responsibilities
              and duties be introduced to youth to empower them to actively
              participate in decision making in institutions at all levels to
              promote justice and reduce inequalities while promoting
              sustainable development.

            We strongly believe linking civic duties with climate change action
            is essential to fostering collective responsibility and encouraging
            active participation in addressing the global climate crisis. By
            linking civic duties with climate change action, we can foster a
            sense of shared responsibility and empower individuals and
            communities to actively contribute to climate solutions. Taking
            collective action can create a positive ripple effect, inspiring
            others to join the effort and drive meaningful change for a more
            sustainable future.
