      <h2>Vision & Focus</h2>
    </div>
    <p>
      Forever Shashi Foundation's vision is to nurture modern environmental,
      social empowerment and sustainable development values and practices by
      bridging society, knowledge from our environment. Our focus is to build
      and create a society where the communities are made-up of and led by
      resilient youth with civic responsibilities towards environment and
      society being an intrinsic part of their identity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, we are far more comfortable making individual environmental
      choices than we are getting involved in local decision-making. This
      mindset is reflected in most environmental outreach. The question is how
      do we change this dynamic?
    </p>
    <p>
      Research tells us that young people develop their sense of civic and
      environmental efficacy and start imbibing social norms between the ages of
      10 and 14. If, during this time they can, while learning, solve problems
      that plague the environment and hence the society, then this action will
      become their tool of choice. This will also make sure that young people
      who have these experiences will continue to use similar means to solve
      environmental and social problems into adulthood. We believe that by
      engaging children from an early age, they can foster a culture of
      responsibility, empathy and leadership among the future generations. By
      investing in the potential of young leaders, it can foster a more
      inclusive, equitable, sustainable and clean world.
    </p>
    <p>
      We endeavor to build a strong and responsible civil society, good
      environmental practices via a passionate youth to safeguard our
      environment, foster ethical societal values and improve the individual’s
      and peoples’ lives.

      Our work revolves around providing awareness and education activities in 4
      Sustainable Development Goals (SDG):
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <b
          >SDG 11: Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient
          and sustainable</b
        ><br />
        As the cities are becoming more populous and seeing rapid development of
        infrastructure, the surrounding environment is slowly disappearing. More
        and more people are living in urban slums without the basic facilities
        of clean water, quality food or clean air. Often, the people living in
        such impoverished backgrounds are the first victims of development and
        climate change. It is becoming more and more critical day by day to
        ensure that cities are built to be eco-friendly, sustainable and
        resilient in order to continue thriving and surviving.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        <b>SDG 12: Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns</b
        ><br />
        The world is seeing rampant obesity and chronic malnutrition at the same
        time. Not only is there a major divide between access to basic food and
        nutrition, more and more food available in the markets are being grown
        and exposed to pesticides and other chemicals while being grown in land
        which has lost a majority of its nutrition causing a shortage of good
        quality raw food further exacerbating the issue of sustainable
        consumption and production patterns leading to a rise in lifestyles
        health issues and diseases.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        <b
          >SDG 13: Take urgent action to combat climate change and its
          impacts</b
        ><br />
        Climate change disproportionately affects vulnerable communities,
        exacerbating existing inequalities. By prioritizing climate action, SDG
        13 aims to ensure that climate policies and actions consider social
        equity, human rights, and economic opportunities for all, leaving no one
        behind. The importance of SDG 13 lies in its recognition of the urgent
        need to address climate change comprehensively and collaboratively. By
        inculcating the need and relevance for environment conscious behaviour
        and sustainable practices we can create a cadre of youth who can foster
        a more sustainable, resilient, and equitable world for current and
        future generations.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        <b
          >SDG 16: Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable
          development, provide access to justice for all and build effective,
          accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels</b
        ><br />
        SDG 16 focuses on promoting peaceful, just, and inclusive societies and
        aims to build effective, accountable, and inclusive institutions at all
        levels. It addresses critical issues related to governance, rule of law,
        access to justice, human rights, and reduction of violence and conflict.
        Building strong and accountable institutions is crucial for achieving
        sustainable development. This can be done by ensuring that
        decision-making processes are inclusive, responsive, and participatory.
        Empowering marginalized groups and amplifying their voices in
        policymaking helps address inequalities and ensures that no one is left
        behind in the development process. This makes it crucial for values of
        human rights, democratic rights and citizenship responsibilities and
        duties be introduced to youth to empower them to actively participate in
        decision making in institutions at all levels to promote justice and
        reduce inequalities while promoting sustainable development.
      </li>
      <br />
    </ol>
    <p>
      We strongly believe linking civic duties with climate change action is
      essential to fostering collective responsibility and encouraging active
      participation in addressing the global climate crisis. By linking civic
      duties with climate change action, we can foster a sense of shared
      responsibility and empower individuals and communities to actively
      contribute to climate solutions. Taking collective action can create a
      positive ripple effect, inspiring others to join the effort and drive
      meaningful change for a more sustainable future.
