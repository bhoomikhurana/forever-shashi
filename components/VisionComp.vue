        <p>
          We at FSF envision a society where the communities are made-up of and
          lead by resilient youth with civic responsibilities towards
          environment and society being an intrinsic part of their identity.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          We believe that by engaging children from an early age, they can
          foster a culture of responsibility, empathy and leadership among the
          future generations. By investing in the potential of young leaders, it
          can foster a more inclusive, equitable, sustainable and clean world.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          As an organization we wish to work with adolescents and youth to
          provide them awareness and knowledge related to environment awareness
          and sustainability practices, civic responsibilities and duties and
          issues of injustice and inequality. Furthermore, provide them a
          platform for connecting with other like-minded individuals to create
          movements of change. We work with them to develop their skills,
          confidence and vision for a better future with the aspirations of
          nudging them to become leaders and changemakers in their communities
          and beyond.
