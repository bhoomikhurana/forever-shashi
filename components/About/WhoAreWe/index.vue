        Forever Shashi Foundation (FSF) a registered pan-India NGO with the aim
        to educate and empower adolescents and youth on various social and
        environmental issues. We employ experiential and participatory learning
        to the issues via workshops, training, campaigns and community building
        activities
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The foundation’s methodology is founded in the belief that by engaging
        children in these issues from an early age, they can foster a culture of
        responsibility, awareness and action among the future generations.
